# 💰 Scamming – Zero Tolerance

Scamming is strictly prohibited under all circumstances.
Any intentional deception used to obtain money, items, vehicles, services, or property from another player is not allowed, regardless of roleplay context.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- Taking payment without delivering the agreed item or service
- Fake or misleading sales, trades, or contracts
- Impersonation (players, staff, businesses, or organisations)
- False promises, bait-and-switch tactics, or misleading terms
- Abuse of game mechanics, UI, or systems to deceive another player

*“It was RP”* is not a valid defence.
Any confirmed scamming will result in immediate staff action, including item/money removal, character wipes, or permanent bans.
