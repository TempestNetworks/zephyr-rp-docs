# ðŸ«¡ Respect for Staff & Community

Every member of our community, whether they are a player or a staff member, deserves to be treated with respect. Insults, derogatory language, harassment, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated. Engaging in disruptive or harmful behavior that affects the gameplay or the community's environment is strictly prohibited. This includes trolling, griefing, spamming, or cheating.

Instigating drama will not be tolerated and you may face permanent removal if found doing this.

If you have issues or conflicts with other players or staff, address them calmly and privately through the appropriate channels, such as our support system. Public drama or disputes can be disruptive to the community.

When providing players with a genuine realistic roleplaying experience, Zephyr RP aims to adhere to the rules and expectations established in the guidelines that follow.

Players should always prefer words over weapons for greater roleplay, even though it can be simple to roleplay as the city's worst criminal.

All players must be at least 16 years old to access and play Zephyr RP.
