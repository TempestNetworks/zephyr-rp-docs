# 🛡️ Anti-Cheat Policy

### 🔍 Our Commitment

Zephyr is built on fair play, transparency, and trust. We’re here to keep cheaters, exploiters, and IRL traders out—without invading your privacy.

### ⚙️ How Our Anti-Cheat Works

We use smart, behavior-based systems to detect cheating. We flag for:

- 🎯 Impossible weapon accuracy or movement
- 🧠 Inhuman reaction speeds or inputs
- 💻 Script injections or unauthorized commands
- 🧩 Known cheat exploit signatures We do not automatically ban players. Every case goes through manual staff review.

### 🔍 PC Checks (With Consent Only)

If needed, we may ask to conduct a PC check, using approved third-party tools.
- ✅ Consent is required.
- 🚫 No spyware. No remote desktop. No hidden tools.
- ❌ Refusing a PC check without clear communication may result in permanent removal.
- 🧾 We Don’t Sell Safety If you're caught cheating, exploiting, or IRL trading, you cannot buy your way back. No paid unbans. No exceptions.

### 📚 Player History: A Factor, Not a Sentence

We may consider prior bans or public records only when:

- Multiple flags occur in our system
- You're widely known for griefing or cheating
- Reports come with clear evidence (e.g. logs, videos, screenshots)
- We don’t auto-ban for your past — we just use it to support investigations.
- People change. Context matters.

### 🚨 The Flagging & Review System

**Tier 1 – Minor Suspicion**

    🟡 Example: One-off abnormal behavior

    ✅ Action: Logged & silently monitored

**Tier 2 – Moderate Suspicion**

    🟠 Example: Repeat flags or dodgy reports

    ⚠️ Action: Staff review & possible player contact

**Tier 3 – High Suspicion**

    🔴 Example: Consistent severe flags or cheat attempts

    ⛔ Action: Temporary ban while logs are reviewed

    All bans are reviewed by trusted staff—no auto-bans, no AI calls the shots.
