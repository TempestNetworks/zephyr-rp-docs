# 🎭 ## Fail RP

**Fail RP refers to actions that break immersion, realism, or logical roleplay expectations.**  
Players are expected to value their character’s life, injuries, and the world around them at all times.

Fail RP includes, but is not limited to:
- Ignoring or downplaying serious injuries
- Acting without fear or self-preservation in life-threatening situations
- Unrealistic reactions to being threatened, restrained, or injured
- Instantly recovering from situations that would reasonably impact your character
- Addressing players by their Steam/Discord unless it's their nickname
- Ramming or pitting at speeds exceeding 150 KM/h
- Carrying whilst in the driver seat of ANY vehicle

**Examples of Fail RP:**
- Being shot and immediately sprinting or fighting without medical attention
- Treating serious injuries as minor inconveniences
- Laughing, joking, or taunting in situations where fear or distress would be expected
- Returning to normal activity immediately after near-death situations
