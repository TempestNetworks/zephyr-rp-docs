# ⚔️ Hostile Roleplay Rules

Hostile roleplay is a core part of criminal interaction within Zephyr City. These rules ensure engagements remain fair, meaningful, and grounded in proper roleplay.

## General Hostile RP

* Hostile RP cannot be initiated on players engaged in legal activities without meaningful interaction beforehand.

* Red Zones operate as shoot on sight areas.

* Boot-checking is not permitted unless meaningful RP occurred prior.

* Using one-way bullet-resistant windows to gain combat advantage is strictly prohibited.

* Killing a player after robbing them breaks the NITRP rule and is not allowed.

* Players may not kill someone then rob them — exception: Cayo Perico.

* If a robbed player escalates to deadly force, lethal retaliation is permitted.

* Hostages must have no personal or gang affiliation with the captor.

* Hostages cannot be taken solely for financial gain.

* ***HELMET'S ARE NOT TO BE USED IN HOSTILITY'S***

## Robberies & Theft

**Robberies may be initiated against players actively performing illegal activities, including:**

* Drug dealing

* Drug processing

* Illegal crafting

* Black market activity

* Any location related to illegal item acquisition

* Robberies may also occur following significant RP lead-up, such as debt collection or recovering stolen items.

* Robbing someone requires proper RP and a valid reason — not just convenience. you should also only take the items related to the scene.

* Killing someone and then robbing them is prohibited unless on Cayo.

* Killing a player after robbing them is strictly forbidden unless they escalate the situation first.

**if you take someone hostage during gang beef you are to only take weapons and comms for saftey reasons. If the hostage behaves you should return the items but if they are uncooperative you may keep the items.\
you may not bait the person to get them to become uncooperative**



## Player-Run Businesses

* Hostile RP inside a player-run business can result in RP consequences such as:

* Business blacklisting

* Organisation blacklisting

* Police investigations and arrests

* Hostile RP cannot be initiated on active workers who are:

* Clocked on duty

* Clearly in uniform

* Workers may not use the business property to avoid an active situation (e.g., barricading themselves inside or clocking on/off mid-scenario).

## Storage Security

* Passwords for containers, houses, gang storage, and any shared storage are given out at your own risk.

* Be cautious with who you trust and where you discuss sensitive information.

## Restart Restrictions

* No hostility may be initiated 30 minutes before or after a server restart.

**Exemption: This restriction does not apply when**

* at illegal crafting locations, or already engaged in illegal activity.

## Heist Rules

* Heists may include a maximum of 6 participants.


* Outfits must match, but gang clothing is not required.

* Players cannot interfere with, disrupt, or third-party another group’s heist under any circumstances.

## Combat Rules

* Tripping may not be used in combat situations to secure a kill.

**Tripping is only allowed when:**

* Attempting to prevent a player from fleeing an RP scenario, or

* Attempting to escape someone pursuing you.

* Tripping for the purpose of executing someone is strictly forbidden.

## Police Interaction Rules
* Police Convoys & Prisoner Transport

* Criminals may attempt to intercept police transport to rescue a detained individual.

* Must include clear declaration

* No ramming permitted

 ## Greenzones 
* No camping outside Green Zones

* No ambushing players entering/exiting

* No shooting into or out of Green Zones. unless its an ongoing situation and someone has run into the green zone. 

* No running into Green Zones to escape fights you started. if you run into a green zone you are not instantly protected. you can still be dealt with accordingly this is to avoid people from abusing them.

* No using the fact you are in a Green zone to talk smack and run your mouth because you are "safe" 

* If you enter a green zone in a hostile scene the greenzone does not apply. 

## Vehicle Combat

**Alllowed**

* Head on ramming

* someone is going slow and you coming in at over 150km and T bone them sending them flying.
