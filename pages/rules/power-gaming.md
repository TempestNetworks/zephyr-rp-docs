# 🦾 Power Gaming

**Powergaming is forcing actions, outcomes, or advantages without giving others a fair opportunity to roleplay.**  
Players must allow situations to develop naturally and collaboratively.

Powergaming includes, but is not limited to:
- Forcing another player’s actions or reactions
- Performing unrealistic or impossible actions
- Acting on outcomes without giving others a chance to respond
- Using mechanics or wording to gain an unfair advantage

**Examples of Powergaming:**
- Forcing a player to get medical attention to continue the scene (this excludes Police RP)
- /me actions that remove another player’s ability to react
- Declaring success without interaction (e.g. “I knock you out” without RP)
- Listening to voices through walls and using that information if you're not in that conversation
- Performing multiple complex actions instantly without opportunity for response
- Using emotes or commands to bypass roleplay progression (Emote canceling and emote exploiting | using emotes during hostilities)
- Using diving tanks for illegal activities is strictly prohibited unless needed for a specific heist (take a outfit bag with you once you have completed the dive part),
- Drugs or Crafting exploits included but not limited to - growing /cooking indoors in areas that a restricted access areas example MLO, Interiors, exploiting the crafting bench distance, setting macro's to AFK farm any activity or step
- ***You CAN NOT search bushes by spam tackling to try and find someone*** this is considered power gaming
