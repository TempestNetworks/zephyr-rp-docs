# ðŸ¦¾ Power Gaming

Power gaming is not allowed. This means that you must engage in roleplay actions. Do not exploit in-game actions to your advantage. Some examples of power gaming include, but are not limited to:

* Forcing a player to get medical attention to continue the scene (this excludes Police RP).,
* Listening to voices through walls and using that information if you're not in that conversation.,
* Emote canceling and emote exploiting (using emotes during hostilities),
* Using diving tanks for illegal activities is strictly prohibited unless needed for a specific heist (take a outfit bag with you once you have completed the dive part),
