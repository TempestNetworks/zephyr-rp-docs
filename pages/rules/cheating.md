# 🕵️‍♂️ Cheating

Cheating, which includes using hacks, scripts, or any third-party software to gain an unfair advantage in the game, is strictly prohibited. We expect all players to engage in fair and honest gameplay. Cheating disrupts the balance of the game and diminishes the experience for others. Exploiting in-game glitches or bugs to gain an unfair advantage is also considered cheating and is not allowed. Violations of this rule will result in immediate and severe consequences, including permanent bans from the community.
