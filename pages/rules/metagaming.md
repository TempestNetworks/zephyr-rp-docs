# 🧠 Metagaming

**Metagaming is strictly prohibited.**  
Players must not use information or knowledge that their character would not reasonably have access to within the in-game world.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Information gained from **Discord, live streams, external chats, or voice calls**
- Information gained while **dead, downed, or spectating**
- Any form of **out-of-character communication** used to influence in-character actions

---

### Voice Identification & Recognition

- **Recognising or identifying a character by their voice alone is considered metagaming**, unless your character has a **clear, prior in-character relationship or interaction history** that reasonably justifies recognition.
- You may **not** identify, call out, or act on a player’s identity solely based on:
  - Voice similarity
  - Accent
  - Speech patterns
  - Familiarity from out-of-character interactions

**Examples of metagaming:**
- “I know that voice, it’s X”
- Identifying masked or unknown individuals without prior in-character justification
- Linking a voice to a character through Discord or other external platforms

---

### External Voice & Communication During RP

- Being in **external voice chats (Discord, phone calls, etc.) during active roleplay situations is strongly discouraged** to remove any possibility of metagaming.
- **Using external voice or communication to coordinate, relay information, or influence in-character actions is considered metagaming**, regardless of intent.

This includes:
- Asking for help or transport out-of-character while incapacitated or dead
- Sharing locations, descriptions, or outcomes externally during RP scenes

---

### Masks, Disguises & Voice Alteration

- **Voice changers, soundboards, or audio-altering software are not permitted under any circumstances.**
- Wearing **masks or physical disguises** is permitted for roleplay purposes.
- If a character is **masked or otherwise concealing their identity**, other players must treat them as **unknown** unless they have strong in-character justification to do otherwise.
- Players may not bypass disguises by relying on voice recognition or out-of-character familiarity.
