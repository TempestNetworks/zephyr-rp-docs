# ðŸ§  Metagaming

Metagaming is strictly prohibited.
\
Players must avoid using information or knowledge that their character wouldn't have access to, including information gained from sources outside of the in-game world, such as Discord chats, live streams, or any other external communication platforms.
\
For example, contacting friends OOC to get picked up by friends whilst you are dead & being in any external platform voice chats whilst in active situations.
