# 🧠 Metagaming

**Metagaming is strictly prohibited.**
\
\
Players must avoid using information or knowledge that their character wouldn’t have access to, including information gained from sources outside of the in-game world, such as Discord chats, live streams, or any other external communication platforms.
\
\
This also includes voice identification. Identifying another character solely based on a player’s real-life voice is considered metagaming. Players must have in-character evidence (such as visual identification, ID cards, known clothing, tattoos, or prior IC interactions) before confirming someone’s identity.
\
\
For example, contacting friends OOC to get picked up while dead, being in external voice chats during active situations, or using voice recognition alone to identify a masked or unknown character.
