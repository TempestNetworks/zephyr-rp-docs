# ðŸ§¾ Expectations

As a gang leader within Zephyr Roleplay, you are entrusted with more than just authority â€” you carry the responsibility of setting the standard for your organisation.

All members of your crew are expected to uphold both the **server-wide rules** and the **gang-specific regulations** at all times. It is your duty to ensure your members are informed, compliant, and held accountable to these expectations.

Leadership isnâ€™t just about calling the shots â€” itâ€™s about maintaining integrity, promoting quality roleplay, and guiding your group to represent the community with respect.
