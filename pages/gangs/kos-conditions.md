# ⚔️ KOS Conditions

KOS is the most serious form of escalation in Zephyr. It’s not meant to be used lightly — it’s the end result of deep tension, real conflict, and roleplay that’s reached its breaking point. Think of it as the last chapter in a long story, not the first page.

***

**📜 How to Set Up a KOS**\
All KOS must be sorted _in-city_ through proper RP. A few valid ways to handle this:

* Face-to-face; or
* Phone call

Before jumping into KOS, there needs to be a real reason and some demands made.\
Make it clear what’ll happen if they don’t cooperate — not just vague threats.

***

**🔁 KOS Doesn’t Last Forever**\
Each KOS runs for a max of 24 hours, anything further requires approval from Gang Staff. If nothing happens in that time, it fades out.\
To keep it going, you’ll need to create new RP — think of it like the next chapter in the story, not a replay of the same one.

***

**🧍 Solo Players Aren’t Free Targets**\
You can’t just KOS someone because of what they’re wearing.\
Make sure the RP is there to back it up.

***

**🏥 Hospitals and Big Scenes Are Off-Limits**\
KOS doesn’t apply at any green-zone.

Attacking in these areas is a big no.

***

**🚫 Don’t Take Advantage of KOS**

* No fake or super vague reasons
* Don’t use it to pick on new or smaller crews
* No hunting people outside conflict zones without RP

If it feels like you’re forcing it, you probably are.

***

**✅ KOS Should Build RP, Not Break It**\
Used right, KOS can create unforgettable stories, settle beef, and shape the city’s future. Just make sure it makes sense, fits the RP, and gives everyone something to work with.
