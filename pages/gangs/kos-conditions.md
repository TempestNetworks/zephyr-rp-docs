# ⚔️ KOS Conditions
KOS is the most serious form of escalation in Zephyr. It’s not meant to be used lightly — it’s the end result of deep tension, real conflict, and roleplay that’s reached its breaking point. Think of it as the last chapter in a long story, not the first page.

## How to Set Up a KOS
All KOS must be sorted in-city through proper RP. A few valid ways to handle this:

Face-to-face; or
Phone call
Before jumping into KOS, there needs to be a real reason and some demands made.
Make it clear what’ll happen if they don’t cooperate — not just vague threats.

## 🔁 KOS Doesn’t Last Forever
Each KOS runs for a max of 24 hours, anything further requires approval from Gang Staff. If nothing happens in that time, it fades out.
To keep it going, you’ll need to create new RP — think of it like the next chapter in the story, not a replay of the same one.

Alot of Situations should only require i single KOS to resolve. You should not be having more then one KOS over small issues. For Example

* Beefing over a instance of disrespect

* Someone selling in your area and not paying tax and it escalates.

* Other small things

If two gangs have had multiple different problems and KOS's and stuff is not resolving you can opt to do a formal Declaration which is three rounds of KOS in which are hosted by staff and allow both gangs to agree to different styles of combat example

* Claiming style rounds

* Bike warefare rounds

* Normal KOS Style

* 30 minute kos rounds in the claiming script.

Also the two gangs can agree to Be in constant KOS in the days leading up to the three rounds. Gangs can set parameters on this like times in which the KOS is on and other rules for example

* only KOS'ing between 7pm & 10pm

* Melee only KOS's in the days before

Both sides NEED to Agree to all terms of the formal Declaration before its Accepted by staff if both sides cant agree staff will set all parameters.

## Solo Players Aren’t Free Targets
You can’t just KOS someone because of what they’re wearing.
Make sure the RP is there to back it up.

🏥 Hospitals and Buisnesses and other green zones

No camping outside Green Zones

No ambushing players entering/exiting

No shooting into or out of Green Zones. unless its an ongoing situation and someone has run into the green zone.

No running into Green Zones to escape fights you started. if you run into a green zone you are not instantly protected. you can still be dealt with accordingly this is to avoid people from abusing them.

No using the fact you are in a Green zone to talk smack and run your mouth because you are "safe"

If you enter a green zone in a hostile scene the greenzone does not apply.

Green zones should be avoided if in a KOS and other hostile scenes to limit civilian and other groups not in the KOS being affected.

## 🚫 Don’t Take Advantage of KOS

* No fake or super vague reasons
* Don’t use it to pick on new or smaller crews
* No hunting people outside conflict zones without RP
* If it feels like you’re forcing it, you probably are.

## KOS Should Build RP, Not Break It
Used right, KOS can create unforgettable stories, settle beef, and shape the city’s future. Just make sure it makes sense, fits the RP, and gives everyone something to work with.

## Setting Demands
When another group provokes your gang (examples: spraying your turf, insulting your crew), you may choose one of two paths: respond with hostility or attempt to de-escalate by issuing demands. Demands are optional — they can be proposed, negotiated, accepted, or refused. Acceptable demands (examples)

Remove graffiti from your territory within a reasonable timeframe.
Pay a realistic fee or tax proportional to the offense (amounts must be plausible given the situation ideally 500k to 5m max in extreme cases. seek staff approval on over 1m fee's).
Rules & consequences Demands must be reasonable and proportional to the offense. Staff may decline or cancel demands they judge to be unrealistic. Repeatedly issuing unrealistic demands may result in those demands—or the entire conflict—being dropped by staff. Demands are not mandatory; groups may refuse them and choose other responses

## Out of Colours
If your gang is involved in an active KOS or ongoing beef, you must wear your gang colours (official gang clothing). You may only go out of colours after being killed, during your hostile cooldown or while waiting for the KOS to expire.

🔴 You cannot go out of colours just to avoid conflict while still participating in the beef. If you're in it — you're in it. Starting a beef and then hiding until it's convenient to return is not allowed.

If you are on a timer AND wearing gang clothing, and you get caught lacking — that’s on YOU. Your timer does NOT protect you if you choose to wear colors, rep a gang, or put yourself in gang activity while on cooldown.*

**simple rule:**
On timer = stay out of colors, stay out of beef, stay out of trouble.

If you put yourself in a gang situation while on timer, you are fair game and staff will not protect you.

If you die in a conflict you should be taking off your gang clothing before leaving the inside of the hospital to avoid any confusion.

## Hostile Timer

Being “on timer” does NOT let you:

* Start fights

* Trash talk

* Bait players

* Hide behind green zones

If you start or escalate a fight, your timer becomes void, and staff will enforce penalties. or kill players on timer

The hostile Timer is default 30 minutes for Beefs and KOS but two gangs can agree to have shorter or no hostile cooldown timers. Ideally you should inform gang staff through your appropriate channels so they are aware if you have agreed to shorter timers.
