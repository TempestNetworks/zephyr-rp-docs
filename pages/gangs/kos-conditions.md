# ⚔️ KOS Conditions

KOS is the most serious form of escalation in Zephyr. It’s not meant to be used lightly — it’s the end result of deep tension, real conflict, and roleplay that’s reached its breaking point. Think of it as the last chapter in a long story, not the first page.

***

**📜 How to Set Up a KOS**\
All KOS must be sorted _in-city_ through proper RP. A few valid ways to handle this:

* Face-to-face; or
* Phone call

Before jumping into KOS, there needs to be a real reason and some demands made.\
Make it clear what’ll happen if they don’t cooperate — not just vague threats.

***

**🔁 KOS Doesn’t Last Forever**\
Each KOS runs for a max of 24 hours, anything further requires approval from Gang Staff. If nothing happens in that time, it fades out.\
To keep it going, you’ll need to create new RP — think of it like the next chapter in the story, not a replay of the same one.

***

**🧍 Solo Players Aren’t Free Targets**\
You can’t just KOS someone because of what they’re wearing.\
Make sure the RP is there to back it up.

***

**🏥 Hospitals and Big Scenes Are Off-Limits**\
KOS doesn’t apply at any green-zone.
If you take the hostility INTO the green zone then you will be merked in the green zone.

Attacking in these areas is a big no.

***

**🚫 Don’t Take Advantage of KOS**

* No fake or super vague reasons
* Don’t use it to pick on new or smaller crews
* No hunting people outside conflict zones without RP

If it feels like you’re forcing it, you probably are.

***

**✅ KOS Should Build RP, Not Break It**\
Used right, KOS can create unforgettable stories, settle beef, and shape the city’s future. Just make sure it makes sense, fits the RP, and gives everyone something to work with.

***

**📜 Setting Demands** 
When another group provokes your gang (examples: spraying your turf, insulting your crew), you may choose one of two paths: respond with hostility or attempt to de-escalate by issuing demands. Demands are optional — they can be proposed, negotiated, accepted, or refused.
Acceptable demands (examples)
- Remove graffiti from your territory within a reasonable timeframe.
- Pay a realistic fee or tax proportional to the offense (amounts must be plausible given the situation).

**Rules & consequences**
Demands must be reasonable and proportional to the offense.
Staff may decline or cancel demands they judge to be unrealistic. Repeatedly issuing unrealistic demands may result in those demands—or the entire conflict—being dropped by staff.
Demands are not mandatory; groups may refuse them and choose other responses

***

**🧥 Out of Colours**\
If your gang is involved in an active KOS or ongoing beef, you must wear your gang colours (official gang clothing).
You may only go out of colours after being killed, during your hostile cooldown or while waiting for the KOS to expire.

🔴 You cannot go out of colours just to avoid conflict while still participating in the beef.
If you're in it — you're in it. Starting a beef and then hiding until it's convenient to return is not allowed.
