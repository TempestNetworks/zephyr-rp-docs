# 🚗 Vehicle Guidelines

Gangs are expected to operate with a clear sense of identity — and that includes what they drive. Vehicle use during operations, wars, and hostile scenarios must follow consistent guidelines to ensure fairness and immersion.

***

**🎨 Uniform Vehicle Appearance**

* All vehicles used in gang operations must share the **same colour**
* This applies to **cars, bikes, and helicopters**
* Using mismatched vehicles or changing colours mid-fight to confuse others is **strictly prohibited**

Your vehicle fleet is part of your gang’s identity — keep it consistent.

***

**🏍️ Motorbike Restrictions**

* Crews may use a maximum of **2 motorbikes** during any hostile engagement
* If a motorbike is **blown up or destroyed**, another motorcycle is <mark style="color:red;">**NOT**</mark> permitted to be pulled out for the duration of the event
* Bikes <mark style="color:green;">**MAY**</mark> be **repaired on-scene**, but cannot be replaced if fully lost

No spamming bikes from garages — if it’s gone, it’s gone.

***

**🚁 Helicopter Policy**

* Gangs are allowed **1 helicopter** during any active scenario
* It must follow **RP justification** for its use (e.g. scouting, pickup — not mass transport)
* If the heli is destroyed, **it is permitted to be repaired, however a new heli is not permitted to be taken out** under any circumstance until the scenario is concluded

Operational vehicles are a tool, not a cheat code. Abuse the system, and your access will be restricted — or removed entirely.
