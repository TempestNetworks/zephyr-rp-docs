# 🏷️ Gang Progression

Progression within the Zephyr criminal ecosystem is earned — not handed out. Crews must prove their consistency, quality of roleplay, and impact on the server to climb through the ranks.

Each level unlocks greater privileges, larger rosters, increased hostile capacity, and enhanced customisation options. Progression is reviewed and approved by Gang Staff and must reflect long-term value, not just activity spikes.
