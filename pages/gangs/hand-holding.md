# ðŸ«± Hand Holding

Itâ€™s natural for organisations to have allies, respect between leaders, or shared history â€” but when it comes to **hostile situations**, every crew is expected to **stand on its own**.

**ðŸš« No Hand Holding**

* Crews **cannot assist each other** during any hostile event â€” this includes, but is not limited to:
  * Shootouts
  * Hostilities
  * KOS
  * Wars
* Even if you're on good terms, **jumping in to help another gang mid-conflict** will be treated as a breach of this rule
* Crews may **form business and trading relationships** for RP purposes

***

At the end of the day, Zephyr gang RP is built around **crew independence and rivalry**. If youâ€™re in a war, handle it with your own boots on the ground.
