# ❌ Strike System

The Strike System is designed to keep crews in line — not through instant bans or warnings, but through **immersive punishments** that make you feel the weight of your actions in-city.

Rather than jump straight to disbandment, crews are hit where it hurts: their time, resources, and rep. Strike penalties scale with severity and are handled **IC where possible**, unless the situation requires direct staff escalation.

# Minor Strikes for Gangs: 
Minor strikes will be issued for poor behavior, rule violations, or issues in the city. This includes:

* Poor or no RP

* Bad behavior during gang-to-gang conflicts

* Poor interactions with PD or civilians

* Any other infractions that disrupt the experience or violate server rules

***Note:*** This list is not exhaustive, and minor strikes can be issued for any other interactions in the city at staff discretion.

# In-City Fee for Minor Strikes:

If your gang accumulates minor strikes, the following in-city fees will be applied:

1st Minor Strike: 3 Million

2nd Minor Strike: 5 Million

3rd Minor Strike: 8 Million
After 3 minor strikes, your gang will receive a Major Strike.

# Major Strikes for Gangs:

Major strikes will still be issued for severe infractions, regardless of the number of minor strikes. The consequences are as follows:

1st Major Strike: 12 Million fee and a one-week hostile cooldown (your gang cannot engage in hostile actions during this time).

2nd Major Strike: 15 Million fee, a one-week hostile cooldown, and possible demotion of your gang’s standing within the server.

A third major strike will result in removal of your gang from the server.

# Strike Duration:

The first major strike will last 30 days, and the second major strike will last 60 days.

***Warning System:***
There is no warnings Instead, minor strikes will allow us to address issues earlier. However, if a situation is severe enough, a gang can still receive a Major Strike directly, bypassing the minor strike system.

***Please ensure your gang maintains good behavior and RP throughout all interactions in the city—whether with other gangs, PD, or civilians. Our goal is to keep everything fun, fair, and balanced. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.***

ℹ️ **Other ways to get Disbanded:**

* Community disruption & toxicity after receiving an informal & formal warning for it.
* Direct threat towards players or staff & severe disrespect. An org will be instantly disbanded if doxxing, leaking, IRL trading & members cheating and participating in the spawning of items with IRL trading and exploitation of the server.

This system is here to **create tension, not kill RP**. But if you're not contributing to the world — or worse, actively harming it — your crew will feel the consequences.
