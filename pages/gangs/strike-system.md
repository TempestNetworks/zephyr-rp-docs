# ‚ùå Strike System

The Strike System is designed to keep crews in line ‚Äî not through instant bans or warnings, but through **immersive punishments** that make you feel the weight of your actions in-city.

Rather than jump straight to disbandment, crews are hit where it hurts: their time, resources, and rep. Strike penalties scale with severity and are handled **IC where possible**, unless the situation requires direct staff escalation.

***

**‚ö†Ô∏è Strike One ‚Äì Disruption Fee**

Your crew has drawn unwanted heat.

* Must pay **$50,000 in dirty money** to the "cleaner" contact
* A **2-day hostile cooldown** is enforced (no offensive actions)
* Leadership part takes in a _Ted Talk_ from Gang Staff

> Think of it as a bribe to keep your heat off the streets.

***

**üöß Strike Two ‚Äì Resource Drain**

The city‚Äôs watching you now.

* **$100,000 dirty fine**
* Your gang must submit **materials or goods** (e.g. 200x scrap, 50x pistol ammo, 20x repair kits ‚Äî varies)
* Spray use is **disabled for 3 days**
* 1 tier downgrade _may_ be enforced depending on context
* Access to **vendors & gang stash is locked for 5 days**
* Must complete a **gang RP task** assigned by staff (e.g. public clean-up job, peace treaty negotiation, or a fake charity drive)

> You're bleeding resources to survive. Better tighten up.

***

**üü• Strike Three - Disbandment**

You've reached the end of the line.

* Your gang is **officially disbanded**, roster wiped
* Any attempt to reform without clearance will result in a **server-wide blacklist from gang activity**
* Leaders may appeal after **30 days**, but it is not guaranteed

> You had your chances. You chose chaos. Now you pay the price.

***

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Other ways to get Disbanded:**

* Community disruption & toxicity after receiving an informal & formal warning for it.
* Direct threat towards players or staff & severe disrespect. An org will be instantly disbanded if doxxing, leaking, IRL trading & members cheating and participating in the spawning of items with IRL trading and exploitation of the server.

This system is here to **create tension, not kill RP**. But if you're not contributing to the world ‚Äî or worse, actively harming it ‚Äî your crew will feel the consequences.
