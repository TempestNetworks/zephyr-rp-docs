# Toxicity
A bit of heat is expected in gang RP — tension, ego, and some back-and-forth is all part of the life. But there’s a line, and in Zephyr, it’s important we keep things clean while still having fun.

🗣️ In-Character Trash Talk

Shit talking is permitted, as long as it stays in-character and makes sense within the RP
If you're beefing with a crew, let the tension build — but it should be justified, not just thrown around for no reason
Anything that crosses into OOC attacks, real-life insults, or personal digs is strictly off-limits
🚫 Not Okay, Under Any Circumstance

Sexual emotes or actions toward other players
Spitting, /me trolling, or purposely humiliating others with non-consensual RP
Use of racist, homophobic, or discriminatory language — even “in character”
Targeted harassment, whether it’s through text, voice, or emotes
Talking over dead bodys in hostiles
Emotes like peeing on people and any other emotes like this
