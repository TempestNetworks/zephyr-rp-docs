# 🧂 Toxicity

A bit of heat is expected in gang RP — tension, ego, and some back-and-forth is all part of the life. But there’s a line, and in Zephyr, it’s important we keep things clean while still having fun.

***

**🗣️ In-Character Trash Talk**

* Shit talking **is permitted**, as long as it stays **in-character** and **makes sense within the RP**
* If you're beefing with a crew, let the tension build — but it should be justified, not just thrown around for no reason
* Anything that crosses into **OOC attacks, real-life insults, or personal digs** is strictly off-limits

***

**🚫 Not Okay, Under Any Circumstance**

* **Sexual emotes** or actions toward other players
* **Spitting**, **/me trolling**, or purposely humiliating others with non-consensual RP
* Use of **racist**, **homophobic**, or **discriminatory** language — even “in character”
* **Targeted harassment**, whether it’s through text, voice, or emotes

***

RP is supposed to be intense — not personal. Keep your character sharp, but always separate IC from OOC. If you're unsure whether you're crossing a line, play it safe and steer clear.
