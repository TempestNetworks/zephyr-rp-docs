# 🧥 Dress Code
During any hostile scenario — including KOS zones, war situations, or escalated conflicts — your crew must follow a clear and consistent dress code to ensure fair engagements and visual identification.

This isn’t just about style — it’s about accountability, clarity, and proper roleplay.

## Clothing Identification Rules

To keep hostile roleplay clear, fair, and immersive, all groups engaging in gang-related hostilities must follow the clothing and identifier guidelines below:

* **Clear Identification:** During any hostile situation, all involved members of a gang must be easily identifiable. This means wearing consistent gang clothing, colours, or clear identifiers that make it obvious who you represent.

* **Matching Attire in Hostiles:** If you are participating in a hostile action, you are required to dress the same or in a clearly matching theme as the rest of your group. Everyone involved must appear visually connected. If you have two different colour ways (say black/green and white/green) you must all be in the same colour way.

* **Rep Your Gang Properly:** When going into hostiles, you should be repping your gang as much as possible—this includes colours, patterns, masks, jackets, or any other signature pieces your gang uses. you should be in your full fit not just using some of the clothing.

* **No “Hidden” Hostiles:** Attempting to disguise yourself, blend in with civilians, or intentionally wear neutral clothing to make identification harder during hostilities is not allowed.

* **Accountability:** If a gang fails to clearly identify themselves during a hostile situation, the scene may be voided, punishments may apply, or gang strikes may be issued depending on severity.

## Visibility Matters

Clothing must be visibly identifiable from a distance
Use gang colours or patterns where possible
Attempting to “blend in” to bait or confuse other gangs will result in staff action
You are permitted to have two colour variants for your gang clothing
Failure to follow the Dress Code will result in punishments at the discretion of Gang Staff

Your crew should be seen, recognised, and respected — make sure you look the part.
