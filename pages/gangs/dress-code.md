# 🧥 Dress Code

During any hostile scenario — including **KOS zones, war situations, or escalated conflicts** — your crew must follow a clear and consistent dress code to ensure fair engagements and visual identification.

This isn’t just about style — it’s about accountability, clarity, and proper roleplay.

***

**🧢 Three-Point Identification Rule**

All participating members **must wear a minimum of three identifiable clothing items** that represent their gang.

These can include:

* A **shirt or jacket**
* A **vest or outerwear layer**
* **Pants** (count as **half a point**)

These cannot include:

* Mask
* Chains & Jewellery
* Rags
* Backpacks & Shoes

***

**👁️ Visibility Matters**

* Clothing must be **visibly identifiable from a distance**
* Use **gang colours or patterns** where possible
* Attempting to “blend in” to bait or confuse other gangs will result in **staff action**
* You are permitted to have two colour variants for your gang clothing

***

Failure to follow the Dress Code will result in punishments at the discretion of Gang Staff

***

Your crew should be **seen, recognised, and respected** — make sure you look the part.

***
### Under no circumstances are you to wear other gangs clothing unless you have roleplayed taking a piece during escolation and beef.
