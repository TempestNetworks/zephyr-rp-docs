# 💣 Escalation Rules

In Zephyr Roleplay, conflict isn’t about who shoots first — it’s about **building tension**, telling a story, and giving RP a chance to breathe. Every gang conflict must follow a natural progression, with **words first, weapons last**.

[Failing to follow proper escalation may lead to the delay of progression of your org, with the possibility of staff intervention. ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

***

**🗣️ 1. Talk It Out – Words First**

<mark style="color:red;">**EVERY**</mark> conflict starts with a conversation.

* Leaders must make a genuine effort to resolve tensions through a **sit-down or confrontation**
* Hostilities cannot begin without clear in city reasoning or interaction
* Disrespect, ego, or unresolved disputes are valid RP fuel — but they must be voiced

> Think: “Let’s meet at the pub and talk this out” — not “See you at the morgue.”

***

**🥊 2. Melee Escalation – Show of Strength**

If words fail, and egos flare, it’s time to settle it the old-fashioned way.

* Fists, bats, and melee weapons are the **next logical escalation**
* This stage should still allow for resolution without permanent consequences
* Gang-on-gang scraps, body shots, and fights for honour all fall under this

> A brawl settles tension — or starts the real war.

***

**🔫 3. Weapon Conflict – Point of No Return**

Only after failed talks **and** a melee conflict (or ambush) can it escalate to firearms, so long as both groups agree.

* Shootouts, drive-bys, ambushes, and turf raids with weapons must be **properly justified**
* At this stage, you must be ready to face staff intervention if escalation is deemed invalid
* **Declaration must still occur** — no silent kills, sniping, or one-sided wipeouts without RP lead-up

> Once the bullets fly, there's no turning back.
