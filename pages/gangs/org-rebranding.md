# 🆔 Org Rebranding

Crews grow, evolve, and sometimes outgrow their name or image — and that’s totally fine. Rebranding is allowed in Zephyr, but it needs to be done the right way.

***

**📝 How to Rebrand**

* If your organisation wants to rebrand (name, colour, or identity), you’ll need to **open a ticket** and speak to a member of Gang Staff
* You must clearly state:
  * Your **new name**
  * Your **updated colour scheme** or style
  * Any **changes to your RP direction** or theme

***

**⚠️ What to Keep in Mind**

* Rebranding may **impact your current rank or tier**
  * If you're changing core elements of your crew, you may be **moved down temporarily** until the new identity proves itself
* You can’t rebrand just to dodge heat or conflict — that’ll get shut down quickly

A rebrand can be a fresh start — but it’s also a reset in the eyes of the city. If you’re switching it up, make sure you’re ready to stand on it.
