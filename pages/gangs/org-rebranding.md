# üÜî Org Rebranding

Crews grow, evolve, and sometimes outgrow their name or image ‚Äî and that‚Äôs totally fine. Rebranding is allowed in Zephyr, but it needs to be done the right way.

***

# First Instance:

In-City Fee: A standard rebranding fee will be applied.

No Impact on Progression or Rank: Your gang's progression and rank will remain unaffected by this rebranding.

Approval Requirement: To proceed with rebranding, a minimum number of original gang members must be present in the gang.

Discretion: Final approval will be based on gang management's discretion.

# Second Instance:

In-City Fee: A larger rebranding fee will be imposed.

Possible Impact on Progression: Your gang's progression may be affected based on the circumstances.

Approval Requirement: A minimum number of original gang members must be present for approval.

Discretion: Gang management has full discretion to approve or deny the rebrand request.

# Third Instance:

Substantial Fee: A very large rebranding fee will be applied.

Demotion: A demotion of at least one rank within the gang will occur, in addition to the fee.

Approval Requirement: Again, a minimum number of original gang members must be present for rebranding approval.

Severe Consequences: Multiple rebrands show a lack of consistency and can have a long-term impact on your gang‚Äôs reputation and position. Gang management will carefully review the situation before approval.

***Additional Note:***

If multiple high-ranking members or leaders leave the gang, the rebranding request may still be denied. The gang may not retain the same rank or position if the original leadership has departed, as we don‚Äôt want individuals to maintain rank when the original members are no longer involved.

**‚ö†Ô∏è What to Keep in Mind**

* Rebranding may **impact your current rank or tier**
  * If you're changing core elements of your crew, you may be **moved down temporarily** until the new identity proves itself
* You can‚Äôt rebrand just to dodge heat or conflict ‚Äî that‚Äôll get shut down quickly

***

A rebrand can be a fresh start ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also a reset in the eyes of the city. If you‚Äôre switching it up, make sure you‚Äôre ready to stand on it.
