**🧨 Vendor  Decs**

If you want to declare on someone’s vendor, you must follow these steps in order:

## 1) Catch Them at the Vendor Door

You can ONLY declare if the owner is physically at their vendor door.

No declaring through texts, phone calls, or anywhere else.

## 2) Hold Them Up & Confirm It’s Their Door

You must prove they own the vendor.
A simple way to do this:

* Give them a vendor key

* Make them knock or unlock the door

* You must see that the key actually works on the door

The people who have the vendor must go ahead with this as failing to do so with guns on them is failing fear for life.

## 3) Check What’s Inside the Vendor

* Confirm what items are inside the vendor

* Make sure you know what you’re actually declaring on

This stops people from making false or random declarations.

## 4) Declare Right There on the Spot

Once it’s confirmed, you must declare at the door.
Just say something clear like:

* “We’re coming for this door.”

* “We’re declaring on this vendor.”

## After you declare:

After the declaration is made, a meeting can happen if needed. This meeting can:

* Happen right at the vendor door right then and there if everyone agrees

* Be organised for later at a safe location

* what ever suits the RP scene

This meeting is mainly for situations where:

* The person caught at the door isn’t the leader of the group

* The declaring group wants to speak with someone who has authority

* Both sides want to discuss terms, expectations, or avoid confusion

The key point:
➡️ The declaration MUST still be made at the door.
The meeting is only to clarify things afterwards.

# Vendor Rules

* Once you have secured a vendor you will have 3 days / 6 restarts to operate it without challenge or raid

* All Vendor access MUST be done in your appropriate Org Identifiers and treated with HOSTILE ROLEPLAY not KOS

* All Vendor activity inlcuding but not limited to - staking out, ambushes, kidnapping, raids , investigations must be done in the correct identifiers

* Undercover Detective and Uniformed Detective roleplay will have requirements to make their investigation valid

Vendor access isn’t permanent — it’s earned and maintained. Abuse it, and you’ll lose it. Respect it, and you might just control the city’s supply line.
