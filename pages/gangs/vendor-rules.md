# ðŸ§¾ Vendor Rules & Declaration

Vendor and blueprint access is restricted based on your crew's tier, and misuse will result in serious consequences.

***

**ðŸ›’ Who Can Hold What?**

* **Crews**
  * May hold **either** a **Tier 1 weapon vendor** _or_ an **Attachment vendor** â€” not both
* **Organisations**
  * May hold **either one Tier 2 vendor** _or_ **one Tier 3 vendor**
* **Syndicated**
  * May hold **both Tier 2 and Tier 3 vendors** at the same time

***

**ðŸ§¨ Vendor Robberies & Decs**

* Robbing at vendors is permitted â€” but only with **valid roleplay beforehand**
* You can **declare on a vendor holder regardless of their tier**, as long as there is appropriate declaration, all KOS rules are followed and the initiating org has proof of what the vendor contains.
* Organisations are expected to maintain a level of discretion and respect when it comes to vendor access. Publicly sharing the location of another crewâ€™s vendor (e.g. posting it on Birdy or shouting it out in public) is **strictly not allowed**.
* Vendor information should be kept **private** â€” baiting other crews by exposing their supply spots will be treated as a serious breach of conduct.
* Once declared, the vendor holder has full rights to **defend, retaliate, or request mediation**

***
Once you have secured a vendor you will have 3 days / 6 restarts to operate it without challenge or raid
All Vendor access MUST be done in your appropriate Org Identifiers and treated with HOSTILE ROLEPLAY not KOS
All Vendor activity inlcuding but not limited to - staking out, ambushes, kidnapping, raids , investigations must be done in the correct identifiers
Undercover Detective and Uniformed Detective roleplay will have requirements to make their investigation valid

Vendor access isnâ€™t permanent â€” itâ€™s earned and maintained. Abuse it, and youâ€™ll lose it. Respect it, and you might just control the cityâ€™s supply line.
