# 🧭 Compound Breaching

Breaking into another crew’s compound isn’t just some petty robbery — it’s a full-blown statement. In Zephyr, breaches are allowed, but they have to be done **right** — with proper tools, cooldowns, and solid RP behind them.

**🧰 Getting the Breach Kit**

You can’t just show up and blow down the door — you’ll need a **special breaching item**, only available through **Gang Management**.

Here’s how you get one:

* [Reach out to Gang Staff in city (this will become clear once you begin operating as an established gang)](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

***

**⏳ How Often Can You Breach?**

* Once **every 3 days** — no matter if you succeed or fail
* This keeps things **strategic**, not spammed

***

**🏠 Defending the Fort**

If someone hits your turf:

* You’re allowed to **defend it like any hostile situation**
* Once it’s over, the beef cools
* Retaliation’s fine, just make sure you follow **escalation rules**

***

Breach smart. Breach loud. And don’t waste it on some half-baked revenge mission. If you’re pulling up, make it count.
