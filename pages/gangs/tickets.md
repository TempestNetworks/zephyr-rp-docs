# 🎟️ Tickets

Zephyr is a roleplay-first server — and that includes how you handle problems. Before reaching for a ticket, ask yourself: **Can this be solved through RP?**

In most cases, the answer should be yes.

**🎭 Let RP Lead the Way**

* Crew conflicts, tension, disrespect, or beef? **Sort it out in-character**
* Tickets should only be used when:
  * A serious rule breach has occurred
  * There's no fair RP path forward
  * Staff intervention is genuinely required
* Jumping straight to tickets over minor issues **breaks immersion** and slows everything down

***

**🚫 No Nagging or Ticket-Spamming**

* Repeatedly asking about:
  * **Promotions**
  * **Vendor access**
  * **Tier changes**
  * Or anything else that’s already been acknowledged

...will be **dismissed without reply**. Let things happen naturally — if you’re on the right path, we’ll notice.

We’re here to help when needed, but this is your story to build. Use RP as your first move, and tickets as your last resort.
