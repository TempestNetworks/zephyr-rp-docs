# 🔐 Crew Structure

To maintain fairness and consistency across Zephyr Roleplay, all crews must operate under a defined structure. This ensures that both members and leadership are held to clear standards and that the gang system remains balanced and immersive.

***

**🔹 Non-Tagged Members**

Non-tagged members are individuals who associate with a crew but are not officially on the roster.\
They may:

* Participate in basic RP interactions with the gang
* Hang around or assist in minor, non-hostile activities

They **may not**:

* Participate in any form of hostile RP (e.g. shootouts, spray contests, robberies)
* Represent the crew in official situations (e.g. wars, vendor access)
* Carry or use the gang's stash or equipment in conflict situations

Attempting to "stack" with non-tagged members during conflict will result in disciplinary action.

***

**🔹 Tagged Members**

Tagged members are officially listed on the crew roster and hold full gang privileges.\
They are allowed to:

* Represent the crew in all hostile and defensive engagements
* Access gang resources (e.g. stash, turf, sprays)
* Participate in declared wars and gang-specific events

It is the leader’s responsibility to ensure that all tagged members are aware of the rules and consequences of representing the crew.

***

**🔄 Tagging Cooldowns**

To prevent roster abuse, the following cooldowns apply:

* **Returning after soft PK or removal:** 3-day hostile cooldown period

Cooldowns are enforced server-wide and may only be waived with Gang Staff approval.

***

**☠️ Soft PKs vs Hard PKs**

* **Soft PK (Partial Death):**
  * You forget the events of the scenario and lose all memory related to the interaction.
  * You may not seek revenge or retaliate based on the event.
* **Hard PK (Full Death):**
  * You permanently lose your character and any ties to the gang or storyline.
  * You must be removed from the roster.
  * Character must be fully deleted and wiped after Hard PK.

All hard PKs must be agreed on between both parties, all agreements must be done in roleplay. Any form of discord agreements will be disregarded and waived entirely. You must have the agreement recorded and clipped through a clipping software which you may be required to provide at the request of Gang Staff.&#x20;

***

**⏳ Death Timer**

Upon death in a gang-related scenario, you must wait **30 minutes** before returning to the area or re-engaging in that same scene.&#x20;

**This timer may be waived** if:

* You are revived **without hostile involvement**
* Gang Staff approve a specific storyline exception
